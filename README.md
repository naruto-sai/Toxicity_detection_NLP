# Toxicity_detection_NLP
The focus is on tackling the challenge of detecting harmful content in memes.

The project aims to curate a diverse image dataset tailored for meme analysis, with a specific focus on Hinglish (Hindi written using English words) memes. It seeks to develop a binary classification model capable of accurately categorizing Hinglish memes as toxic or non-toxic based on nuanced features, including language, imagery, context, and sentiment.
